Prerequisites
=============

.. note::

    Segmentation requires a powerful machine.
    A workstation computer (e.g. Mac Pro or Dell Precision) with at least 16GB of RAM is necessary.
    For smooth viewing of .nii fils in matlab, we recommend at least 24GB of RAM.

aMAP has been tested on Mac (OS X Yosemite) and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) machines, for which binaries are provided.
The NiftyReg command line interface has been designed to also run on Windows, but this has not yet been tested by us
and will require compilation from source.


Image viewer
------------

An image viewer is necessary to check the output of the registration. Recommended are Fiji/ImageJ or ICY.

.. note::

    Although Fiji can currently load .nii images, it is currently unable to save them.
